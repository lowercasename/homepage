## Academic work

My academic work examines the manifestations of utopia, the commons, and precarity in contemporary culture, with a particular interest in post-2008 poetry, novels, and speculative fiction, and cultural production within contemporary global activist movements.

In 2020 I finished writing my PhD dissertation at [Birkbeck, University of London](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/arts/research/research-students/english-and-humanities/Raphael-Kabo).

### Utopian Acts 2018

In 2018, along with [Katie Stone](https://twitter.com/cyborg_feminist), I organised [Utopian Acts 2018](http://utopia.ac/events/utopian-acts-2018/), a one-day festival and conference exploring the relationship between activism, art, and academia. The conference programme, photos, and blog posts are available on the [Utopian Acts](http://utopia.ac/) website.

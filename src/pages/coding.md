## Things I've Built and Other Nonsense

### Utilities

[DocDown](https://github.com/lowercasename/docdown) is a PhD-tested Markdown to Word document converter built into a friendly menu bar app, leveraging the power of Pandoc. [Here's a blog post I wrote about it](/blog/introducing-docdown).

[Orogene](https://github.com/lowercasename/orogene) is the very simple static site generator, written in Rust, which generated this site.

[Charisma](https://github.com/lowercasename/charisma) is an easily adaptable NodeJS-based commenting system for static blogs, featuring a honeypot. See it in action on [my RPG blog](https://wondering.monster).

[RuneCaster](https://github.com/lowercasename/RuneCaster) is a command line utility, written in Python, to generate truly random Elder Futhark rune casts. It uses the RANDOM.ORG API and ancient runic magic.

### Websites

[Sweet](https://sweet.sh) is an experimental, utopian social network. It features directly democratic community management, inbuilt whisper network functionality, and no character limits. I'm [@lowercasename](https://sweet.sh/lowercasename). ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/sweet))

[Gathio](https://gath.io) is an easier and quicker way to make and share events that respects your privacy and doesn't keep your data longer than absolutely necessary. Please use it! ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio)).

[HelloEdit](https://helloedit.raphaelkabo.com) is a Markdown editor disguised as a Macintosh Classic-era word processor. It is modelled on Macintosh System 7 and Microsoft Word 5.1. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/helloedit)).

[Tiny Dungeon](https://tinydungeon.raphaelkabo.com) is a cute, minimalistic D&D combat tracker and dungeon map editor I made as a weekend Node.js project. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/tinydungeon)).

My [utopia generator](https://utopia.raphaelkabo.com/) randomly generates the utopia you deserve, but rarely the one you want.

### Other blogs

[Wondering Monster](https://wondering.monster/) is my indie RPG, D&D and OSR homebrew blog.

### Webcomics

Many years ago I made a webcomic called [Noire](http://noire.raphaelkabo.com) with my friend Nate. It's running in a fragile Docker container because it's incompatible with the terrors of the New Internet, so if it's gone down, give me a yell.

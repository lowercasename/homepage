## Things I've Built and Other Nonsense

### Utilities

[DocDown](https://github.com/lowercasename/docdown) is a PhD-tested Markdown to Word document converter built into a friendly menu bar app, leveraging the power of Pandoc. [Here's a blog post I wrote about it](/blog/introducing-docdown). `Electron`

[Orogene](https://github.com/lowercasename/orogene) is the very simple static site generator which generated this site. `Rust`

[Charisma](https://github.com/lowercasename/charisma) is an easily adaptable commenting system for static blogs, featuring a honeypot. See it in action on [my RPG blog](https://wondering.monster). `Node.js`

[RuneCaster](https://github.com/lowercasename/RuneCaster) is a command line utility which generates truly random Elder Futhark rune casts. It uses the RANDOM.ORG API and ancient runic magic. `Python`

### Websites

[Pond](https://pond.email) is a social newsletter service - an entirely email-based, lo-fi alternative to social networking. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/pond)). `Node.js, Bash, Python, MongoDB`

[Sweet](https://sweet.sh) is an experimental, utopian social network. It features directly democratic community management, inbuilt whisper network functionality, and no character limits. I'm [@lowercasename](https://sweet.sh/lowercasename). ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/sweet)). `Node.js, React Native, MongoDB`

[Gathio](https://gath.io) is an easier and quicker way to make and share events that respects your privacy and doesn't keep your data longer than absolutely necessary. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio)). `Node.js, MongoDB`

[HelloEdit](https://helloedit.raphaelkabo.com) is a Markdown editor disguised as a Macintosh Classic-era word processor. It is modelled on Macintosh System 7 and Microsoft Word 5.1. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/helloedit)). `Node.js`

[Tiny Dungeon](https://tinydungeon.raphaelkabo.com) is a cute, minimalistic D&D combat tracker and dungeon map editor I made as a weekend Node.js project. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/tinydungeon)). `Node.js`

My [utopia generator](https://utopia.raphaelkabo.com/) randomly generates the utopia you deserve, but rarely the one you want. `PHP`

### Games

[Loving Allness](https://loving-allness.mimir.computer) is a game of worlds for 1 to 4 players about creating meanings, telling stories, leaving things behind, and taking others with you. `React, Firebase`

[We Have the Square](https://wehavethesquare.utopia.ac) is a collaborative storytelling game inspired by occupation protest movements, asking players to think through the victories and challenges of creating an oppositional utopian community. `React, Firebase` 

### Other blogs

[Wondering Monster](https://wondering.monster/) is my indie RPG, D&D and OSR homebrew blog.

### Webcomics

Many years ago I made a webcomic called [Noire](http://noire.raphaelkabo.com) with my friend Nate. It's running in a fragile Docker container because it's incompatible with the terrors of the New Internet, so if it's gone down, give me a yell.

## Hire me

I'm currently available for freelance web design and development as well as more esoteric projects in Node.js, React, React Native, Python, and PHP. I'm particularly interested in projects with collective, communal, political, and utopian angles, and will be happy to help out gratis on projects by and for disabled people, people of colour, and queer folk.

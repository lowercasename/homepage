## Code

### Utilities

[DocDown](https://github.com/lowercasename/docdown) is a PhD-tested Markdown to Word document converter built into a friendly menu bar app, leveraging the power of Pandoc. [Here's a blog post I wrote about it](/blog/introducing-docdown). `Electron`

[Orogene](https://github.com/lowercasename/orogene) is the very simple static site generator which generated this site. `Rust`

[Mimir](https://git.sr.ht/~lown/mimir) is an engine for running a small, file-based Markdown wiki or knowledge base. It has no database and features versioning and revision history, authentication, auto-linking, backlinks, and a nice in-browser Markdown editor. `Go`

[Charisma](https://github.com/lowercasename/charisma) is an easily adaptable commenting system for static blogs, featuring a honeypot. See it in action on [my RPG blog](https://wondering.monster). `Node.js`

### Websites

**Sweet** was an experimental, utopian social network. It featured directly democratic community management, inbuilt whisper network functionality, and an Android and iOS app. It ran from March 2019 to February 2022, and had over a thousand registered users. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/sweet)). `Node.js, React Native, MongoDB`

[Gathio](https://gath.io) is an easier and quicker way to make and share events that respects your privacy and doesn't keep your data longer than absolutely necessary. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio)). `Node.js, MongoDB`

[Pointers](https://pointers.website) is a privacy-first link directory, designed for private or intimate links to share with trusted friends. It implements server-side encryption and, in the interest of future resilience, uses no client-side JavaScript. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/pointers)) `Node.js, SQL`

[HelloEdit](https://helloedit.raphaelkabo.com) is a Markdown editor disguised as a Macintosh Classic-era word processor. It is modelled on Macintosh System 7 and Microsoft Word 5.1. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/helloedit)). `Node.js`

[Tiny Dungeon](https://tinydungeon.raphaelkabo.com) is a cute, minimalistic D&D combat tracker and dungeon map editor I made as a weekend Node.js project. ([GitHub](https://github.com/lowercasename/tinydungeon)). `Node.js`

My [utopia generator](https://utopia.raphaelkabo.com/) randomly generates the utopia you deserve, but rarely the one you want. `PHP`

### Games

[Loving Allness](https://loving-allness.mimir.computer) is a game of worlds for 1 to 4 players about creating meanings, telling stories, leaving things behind, and taking others with you. `React, Firebase`

[We Have the Square](https://wehavethesquare.utopia.ac) is a collaborative storytelling game inspired by occupation protest movements, asking players to think through the victories and challenges of creating an oppositional utopian community. `React, Firebase`

### Other blogs

[Wondering Monster](https://wondering.monster/) is my indie RPG, D&D and OSR homebrew blog.

### Webcomics

Many years ago I made a webcomic called [Noire](http://noire.raphaelkabo.com) with my friend Nate. It's running in a fragile Docker container because it's incompatible with the terrors of the New Internet, so if it's gone down, give me a yell.

## Hire me

I'm usually available for freelance web design and development as well as more esoteric projects in Node.js, React, React Native, Python, and PHP. I'm particularly interested in projects with collective, communal, political, and utopian angles, and will be happy to help out gratis on projects by and for disabled people, people of colour, and queer folk.

I am an academic, coder, and poet. I live in London. I work for free and open access to knowledge, the creation of resilient communities, and the arrival of a post-capitalist utopia. Send me an email if you'd like to help.

## Hire me

I'm currently available for freelance web design and development as well as more esoteric projects in Node.js, React, React Native, Python, and PHP. I'm particularly interested in projects with collective, communal, political, and utopian angles, and will be happy to help out gratis on projects by and for disabled people, people of colour, and queer folk.

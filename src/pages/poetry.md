### Fox and Witch (2016)

A story about Fox, who lives in a glass tower in the city, and Witch, who lives in the edgelands beyond the ring road, for two voices and electronic/choral soundscape. Performed at the [Australian National Folk Festival](http://folkfestival.org.au/) 2016 with [Zoë Anderson](http://imaginaryink.tumblr.com/) and [Becki Whitton](https://aphir.bandcamp.com/).

### Canberra Slamboree (2015-Present)

Along with [Zoë Anderson](http://imaginaryink.tumblr.com/), [Aaron Kirby and Fiona McLeod](http://mclirby.com/), I created and hosted [Canberra Slamboree](http://mclirby.com/canberra-slambouree), a poetry slam of sorts. Canberra Slamboree goes on joyfully despite my moving to London. It is Australia's longest and (so far) only scout-themed slam poetry night.

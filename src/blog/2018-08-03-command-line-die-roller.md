Real nerds roll dice from the command line, so I made a command line die roller. It's very basic and doesn't have good error checking, but it's the first proper thing I've ever written in Python. It's heavily adapted from [this script](https://github.com/shadsbot/roll), but I've added the ability to repeat a roll multiple times (while losing the ability to roll multiple sets of dice in the same command, which I will bring back eventually).

It's [available on Github](https://github.com/lowercasename/roll) for all your rolling needs.

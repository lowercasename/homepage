title: "uvcdynctrl-udev.log - a 20GB logfile"

I logged on to my computer on Monday this week and ran `startx` as usual, but Xserver crashed, complaining that it couldn't write to `/tmp`. At first I thought there was an odd permissions issue or some problem with `.Xinitrc`, but it turns out after running some exploratory `du -h` commands that my root partition was completely full.

The culprit turned out to be the file `/var/log/uvcdynctrl-udev.log`, which had ballooned to 20GB in size. The culprit is libwebcam. This is a well-attested problem which apparently still doesn't have a solution:

* [StackOverflow (174GB!)](https://askubuntu.com/questions/177312/filesystem-filling-up-due-to-large-uvcydnctrl-udev-log-file)
* [Ubuntu bug report (800GB!!)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libwebcam/+bug/811604)

I didn't have time to work out how to solve it properly, so I set up a simple-as-it-gets crontab:

```
0 12 * * 1 rm /var/log/uvcdynctrl-udev.log
```

No dramas so far!
